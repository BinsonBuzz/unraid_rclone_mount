# unraid_rclone_mount

unRAID scripts to create rclone vfs mounts on unraid to allow fast launch times with Plex (or Emby).

<b>Plugins needed</b>

<li>Rclone beta – installs rclone and allows the creation of remotes and mounts</li>
<li>User Scripts – to run scripts</li>
<br/>
<b>How It Works </b>
<br/><br>
<li>Rclone is used to access files on your google drive in a mount </li>
<li>Mergerfs is used to merge files on your rclone/google mount with local files that haven't been uploaded yet in another  mount </li>
<li>Dockers that need to play files (Plex, Emby) and dockers that need to add new files (Sonarr, Radarr, nzbget, transmission etc) <b>ALL</b> are mapped to folders <b>WITHIN</b> the <b>MERGERFS MOUNT </b>, not the real local location or the rclone mount </li>
<br/>
<b>1.       Rclone remote setup </b> 
<br><br>
Install the rclone plugin and via command line run rclone config and create 2 remotes: 
<br>
<li>gdrive: - a drive remote that connects to your gdrive account.  Recommend creating your own client_id</li>
<li>gdrive_media_vfs: - a crypt remote that is mounted locally and decrypts the encrypted files uploaded to gdrive:</li>
<br/>
Once complete your rclone_config file should look something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
[gdrive]
<br/>type = drive
<br/>client_id = xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
<br/>client_secret = xxxxx
<br/>scope = drive
<br/>root_folder_id = xxxx
<br/>service_account_file = 
<br/>token = {"xxxxx"}
<br/><br/>
[gdrive_media_vfs]
<br/>type = crypt
<br/>remote = gdrive:crypt
<br/>filename_encryption = standard
<br/>directory_name_encryption = true
<br/>password = xxxx
<br/>password2 = -xxxxx
<br/><br/>

<b>2.       Create Mountcheck files</b>
<br><br>
This blank file is used in the following scripts to verify if the mounts have been created properly.  Run these commands:
<br>
<i>touch mountcheck</i>
<br>
<i>rclone copy mountcheck gdrive_media_vfs: -vv --no-traverse</i>
<br><br>
<b>3.      Mount script</b>
<br><br>
Create a new script in user scripts to create the rclone mount, mergerfs mount and start dockers that need the mounts.  I run this script on a 10 min */10 * * * * schedule so that it automatically remounts if there’s a problem. 
<br>
The script:
<br>
<li>Checks if an instance is already running</li>
<li>Update: Mounts rclone gdrive remote</li>
<li>Update: Mounts mergerfs creating a 3-way union between rclone gdrive remote and local files stored in /mnt/user/local/google_vfs</li>
<li>Starts dockers that need the mergerfs mount e.g. radarr</li>
<br>
I've tried to annotate to make editing easy.  Once the script is added you should have a new folder created at /mnt/user/mount_mergerfs/google_vfs.  Inside this folder add files that you want uploading to google create your media folders i.e. /mnt/user/mount_mergerfs/google_vfs/movies/Star Wars and /mnt/user/mount_mergerfs/google_vfs/Peppa Pig.  These are the folders to map to plex, radarr, sonarr,nzbget etc - DO NOT MAP any folders from local or the rclone mount.
<br><br>
How it works is new files are written in the background to the local RW part of the mergerfs mount (/mnt/user/local/google_vfs), but the dockers can't distinguish between whether the file is local or in the cloud because they are checking /mnt/user/mount_mergerfs. 
<br><br>
A later script moves new files added to /mnt/user/local/google_vfs to the cloud (excluding partial files and files in the download folder so that files can seed etc.); to dockers the files are still in /mnt/user/mount_mergerfs and haven't moved, so nothing has changed for them.
<br><br>
<b>4. Rclone upload script</b>
<br><br>
I run this every hour to move new files from my local drive /mnt/user/local/google_vfs to the cloud.  I have set --bwlimit at 9500K as I find that even that even though this theoretically means I transfer more than google's 750GB/day limit, lower limits don't get me up to this mark.  Experiment with your setup if you've got enough upstream to upload 750GB/day.
<br><br>
I've also added --min age 30mins to again stop any premature uploads.
<br><br>
The script includes some exclusions to stop partial files etc getting uploaded.
<br><br>
<b>5. Unmount Script</b>
<br><br>
I use this at array start to make sure all the 'check' files have been removed properly in case of an unclean shutdown, to ensure the next mount goes smoothly.
